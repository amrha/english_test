# english_test
to access the project you have to use wamp or xamp (I use xamp)
you have to create a database named uti on php my admin
the understanding and reading parts each have a single question repeated 150 times
(while the grammar part has 150 unique questions and the dictation part has 50
question) since the important thing is not the questions themselves but how they are
integrated into the site.
you can use the uti.sql file and import it into the database (or not
  add the function create table)
to access the project you can simply consult this link
